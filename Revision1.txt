creating a branch:
	git checkout -b branch      

pushing it into github:
	git push origin branch

going back to master:
	git checkout master


branch_A is the branch you want to get file from...
branch_own is where you want file added to


1.git checkout branchA
2.git pull  origin branchA 
3.copy file to other folder outside of Repo. (daniel's personal preference: try avoid desktop)
4.git checkout ownbranch
5.copy file into repo
6.git add filename
7. git commit -m "message"
8. git push origin branch_own (optional)


otherwise: git pull branchown (that's just merging the 2 branches)
